  When configuring the WiFi connection on Arduino, after completing the connection and when running the interruption based on timer, 
the ESP32 would kept rebooting for every 4-5 seconds, and the error message stated that the core 0 and core 1 were corrupted. After 
searching on line and seeking for help on forums, the problem was solved by clearing the flash memory before every uploading of Arduino
code.
