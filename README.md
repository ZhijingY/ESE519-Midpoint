## motor operation

We set the operation process of the motor to 150 cycles, and there are three angles of motor rotation. When duty is 0.3 the motor turns the first angle, when duty is 0.6 the motor turns the 2nd angle, when duty is 1 the motor turns the 3rd angle. The rotation of the motor is cycled continuously according to the above rule.
